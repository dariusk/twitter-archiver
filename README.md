# Make your own simple, public, searchable Twitter archive

This is a static website that you can run. It is a website that takes in your Twitter archive zip file, in the format that it is provided circa December 2022, and generates a zip file with another website in it.

Feel free to hack on this if you want it to generate different output than what is available at https://tinysubversions.com/twitter-archive/make-your-own/

## Modified by Andi McClure

This version has been modified to run as an npm app rather than a website. (Andi considers these changes trivial, and so any alterations from the Darius version in this repo you may consider public domain/Creative Commons Zero).

The following commands work:

    npm run dist

Compiles the website (I.E., Darius's original version) into a directory named dist/.
